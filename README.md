# Shortcut App assignment

This project includes a LitElement boilerplate and ui5 standard web components.

# Technology
Built search app using Lit Element library, prebuilt UI5 Ui web components and custom Web Components
I chose the environment and stack because of the following reasons
1. Web components - Reusable and native to browsers; Can be shared among projects with diff technology
2. UI5 - Easy and fast to start creating with basic elements; Require only components in project that will be used
3. Lit Element - Lightweight foundation and can be used alone or within an existing framework; Re-renders on property and html changes
(Note - I've never used Lit or ui5 library before)
